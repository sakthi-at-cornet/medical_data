Report heading and technique say plain and contrast with IV and oral contrast. Images of IV contrast not provided and/or acquired. Images available are plain study and delayed post contrast with oral contrast.
The delayed images show excretion of contrast in the ureters, so IV contrast was administered.

The report mentions that the organs are normal in enhancement and that vascular structures are normal too. As these images are unavailable this is a discrepancy.

Bowel: Main findings related to bowel obstruction have been reported  however:
IC junction not adequately distended, ideally should be unremarkable. Rest of the findings are described.


L4 L5 block vertebra mentioned, cervical lordosis loss mentioned, should be loss of lumbar lordosis. Incorrect term Typing/grammatical error.
